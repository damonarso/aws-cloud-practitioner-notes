Lambda
- Automatically handle scaling, infrastructure, and server management
- Code run only when an event occurs
- Pay only for the compute time you consume
- Limit 15 mins execution time

Containers and Orchestration
- ECS: scalable container orchestration service for running and managing containers on AWS, like Docker containers
-- Streamlined and integrated
-- Define some parameters
-- Fully managed Service
- EKS: fully managed service for running Kubernetes on AWS. It simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using open-source Kubernetes
-- Kubernetes, Open-source
-- More control and flexibility
-- More complex to manage
- ECR
-- Store, manage, and deploy container images
-- Fully managed Docker container registry

Where the app run
- EC2
-- Manage the VMs that run the containers
-- Full control, more management
- Fargate
-- Serverless, no infrastructure to manage

Steps to run a containerized application
1. Upload container image to ECR
2. Choose orchestration service (ECS or EKS)
3. Choose where the app will run (EC2 or Fargate)

Container vs VM
- Container is lighter, faster to start, share OS kernel
- VM uses hypervisor to run multiple OS on a single machine
- Container is more portable, consistent, and efficient

Orchestration tools automate deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications

- Amazon ECS with Amazon EC2: ideal for small-to-medium businesses that need full control over infrastructure. Suitable for custom applications requiring specific hardware or networking configurations, with the flexibility of Amazon EC2 and the simplicity of Amazon ECS.
- Amazon ECS with AWS Fargate: perfect for startups or small teams building web applications with variable traffic. It's a serverless option—no server management required—so teams can focus on development while Amazon ECS handles scaling and orchestration.
- Amazon EKS with Amazon EC2: best for enterprises needing full control over infrastructure. It offers deep customization of EC2 instances alongside Kubernetes scalability—ideal for complex, large-scale workloads.
- Amazon EKS with AWS Fargate: great for teams wanting Kubernetes flexibility without managing servers. It combines Kubernetes power with serverless simplicity, helping to scale applications quickly across various use cases.

Additional Compute Services
- AWS Batch: 
-- Run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud. It dynamically provisions the optimal quantity and type of compute resources (e.g., CPU or memory-optimized instances) based on the volume and specific resource requirements of the batch jobs submitted.
-- Good for: Processing large-scale, parallel workloads in areas like scientific computing, financial risk analysis, media transcoding, big data processing, machine learning training, and genomics research
- AWS Outposts:
-- fully managed hybrid cloud solution that extends AWS infrastructure and services to on-premises data centers
-- Good for: Low-latency applications, local data processing, data residency requirements, and hybrid cloud architectures
- Elastic Beanstalk:
-- easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.
-- Good for: Web applications and services where developers want to focus on writing code without managing the underlying infrastructure
- AWS LightSail:
-- cloud service offering virtual private servers (VPSs), storage, databases, and networking at a predictable monthly price.
-- Good for: Simple web applications, websites, blogs, e-commerce sites, and small business applications that require a straightforward and cost-effective hosting solution
