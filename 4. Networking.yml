Networking Components:
- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): isolated section of the AWS Cloud
-- Increase Security
-- Save Time
-- Control Network Configuration
- Subnets (Public and Private):
-- Public Subnet: accessible from the internet. Web servers
-- Private Subnet: not accessible from the internet. DB, transactional info
- Internet Gateway: allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet
- Virtual Private Gateway: Enable VPN connections between your VPC and your on-premises network

Connecting to AWS Cloud:
- AWS Client VPN: Connect remote workers and on-premises networks to AWS. OpenVPN-based client.
-- Benefits: Advanced authentication, remote access. Elastic and fully managed
-- Use case: Remote workforce, secure access to AWS resources
- Site-to-Site VPN: Connect your on-premises network to your AWS VPC
-- Benefits: Secure and private session, accelerates applications. Highly available
-- Use cases: Application migration, secure communication between remote locations
- AWS PrivateLink: Securely access services hosted on AWS in a highly available and scalable manner, without using public IPs
-- Benefits: Secure traffic and connect with simplifed management rules
-- Use cases: connect clients in VPC to resources, other VPCs, and endpoints
- AWS Direct Connect: Dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS
-- Benefits: Reduce network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience
-- Use cases: High bandwidth applications, hybrid cloud, large-scale data transfer
- AWS Transit Gateway: Connects VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub
- NAT Gateway: Enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but prevent the internet from initiating connections with those instances
- API Gateway: Create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale
