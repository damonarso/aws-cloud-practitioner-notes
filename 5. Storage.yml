- Block Storage: Persistent, low-latency block-level storage that attached to EC2 instances like physical hard drives
-- Amazon EC2 instance store: Unmanaged non-peristent, high-performance block storage directly attached to EC2 instances for temporary data
--- Benefits: Automatically available, cost effective, high performance
-- Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS): persistent block storage volumes for EC2 instances. Various types for different workloads
--- Use cases: database hosting, backup storage for apps, rapid deployment of development environments using volume snapshots
--- Benefits: ability to detach and attach to instances, snapshots, can be modified to different type and sizes without downtime
--- EBS Snapshots: Point-in-time backups of EBS volume. Can be used for disaster recovery, data migration, volume resizing, and for creating consistent backups of production workloads
--- Flow:
---- Initial snapshot: baseline and contains all the data blocks that were in use on the volume
---- Subsequent inremental snapshots: Only blocks that have changed since last snapshot are captured and stored
---- Snapshot consolidation and management: Each snapshot appears as a full point-in-time copy. When deleting a snapshot, only unique data to that snapshot is removed. Data referenced by other snapshots is preserved
--- Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager: Automate creation, retention, deletion of EBS snapshots
--- Steps:
---- Create an EBS snapshots policy
---- Select target resource type
---- Exclude volumes
---- Set Custom Schedules
---- Apply Additional Actions
